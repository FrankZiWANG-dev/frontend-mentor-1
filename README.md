# frontend-mentor-1
This is an exercise from Frontend Mentor, called "Order Summary Component".
It's a basic exercise of reproducing a design using HTML and CSS (here, I used Sass).
I am currently looking for reproduce more and more complex designs, both for inspiration and practice.

Hope you like it,
Frank WANG.
